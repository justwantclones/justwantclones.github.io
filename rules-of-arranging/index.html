<h1>Rules of Arranging</h1>

<p>One might absorb this information best if they notated the following in their own handwriting. This would allow for the digesting of concepts at a slower pace.</p>
<p>The rules of arranging are, in one form or another, openly accessible and generally universal in concept. Music that comes from within is personal and singular in initial applicability.</p>
<p>As such, one must compose and arrange what sounds good to them. What sounds good often aligns with the rules of arranging, but will additionally incorporate styles and techniques not presented here.</p>


<h2>I.</h2>
<h3>The Ground Rules Solely for the Purposes of Simplifying Matters</h3>

<ol class="a">

<li>Major Chords

<ol>
<li>I Major chord takes ionian scale (Diatonic).</li>
<li>IV Major chord takes lydian scale (Diatonic).</li>
<li>♭II Major chord takes lydian scale (Non-diatonic).</li>
<li>♭IV Major chord takes lydian scale	(Non-diatonic).</li>
<li>♭VII Major chord takes lydian scale (Non-diatonic).</li>
</ol>
<ul class="a">
<li>Avoid IV + Ionian.</li>
<li>There is no “avoid” in Lydian.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Non-Tonic Minor Seventh Chords

<ol>
<li>ii minor chord takes dorian (Diatonic).</li>
<li>iii minor chord takes phrygian (Diatonic).</li>
<li>vi minor chord takes aeolian (Diatonic).</li>
<li>vii minor chord flat five takese locrian (Diatonic).</li>
<li>ii minor chord flat five takes locrian (Non-diatonic).</li>
<li>iii minor chord flat five takes locrian (Non-diatonic).</li>
<li>♯iv minor chord flat five takes locrian (Non-diatonic).</li>
<li>iv minor chord takes dorian (Non-diatonic).</li>
</ol>

<ul class="a">

<li>Avoid 6 (13) on ii minor chord dorian.</li>
<li>Avoid 2 on iii minor chord phrygian.</li>
<li>Avoid 6 on vi minor chord aeolian.</li>
<li>Avoid 2 on all locrian.</li>
<li>Avoid 6 on iv minor chord dorian.</li>
<li>Basically, all minor seven flat five chords take locrian.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Dominant Seventh Chords

<ol>

<p>H – P5↓= Harmonic minor perfect fifth below</p>
<p>e.g: G7 = C harmonic minor</p>
	
<li>- The altered will be a seven note scale with 3 chord tones and 4 passing tones. The chord tones are 1, 3, ♭7. The passing tones are ♭9, ♯9, ♭5, ♯5.</li>
<li>- 1, 3, ♭7 should be spelled how they should. The 4 passing tones can be spelled any other way.</li>
<li>- There is no “Avoid” note on the altered scale.</li>
<li>- Lydian ♭7 is exactly what it says: it is a lydian scale with a flat seven.</li>
<li>- There is no “Avoid” note on lydian flat seven.</li>

<li>- If sus chord, avoid 3.</li>
<li>- Mixolydian avoid 4 (mixolydian “sus”, avoid 3).</li>

<p> Examples of scales to use:</p>
	
<ol>
	
<li>V7 in major key
<ul>
<li>Mixolydian</li>
<li>Altered</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>V7 in minor key
<ul>
<li>H – P5↓</li>
<li>Altered</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>VII7 in major/minor key
<ul>
<li>Altered</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>I7 in major/minor key
<ul>
<li>Mixolydian</li>
<li>Lydian flat seven</li>
</li>
</ul>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<li>Tonic Minor

<ol>
	
<li>The scale will contain:

<ol>
<li>I, ♭II, III, IV, V, plus ♭VI or ♮VI and/or ♭VII or ♮VII depending on:</li>
<li>Melody</li>
<li>Chord symbol</li>
<li>Bass line</li>
<li>Harmonic content</li>

</ol>

<li>There is no “Avoid” in Tonic Minor.</li>
<li>I, ♭III, V are chord tones. II, IV are passing tones. VI, VII are chord tones (extensions).</li>

</ol>
</li>

</li>

<li>Augmented Seven Chords

<ol>
<li>Whole tone scale can be used.</li>
<li>Augmented scale can be used.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="a">
<li>Try to make the augmented seven chord fit something from the dominant seven chords first.</li>
<li>All notes in whole tone scale are chord tones.</li>
<li>Aside from root, M3, and ♯5, the other notes in augmented scale are chord extensions.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Diminished Chords

<ol>
<li>The substitute of ♯I° is a ii-V in a minor key a major second above the key. e.g. Key of F, substitute for F♯° (♯I°) is Amin7♭5 D7♭9.</li>
<li>The substitute for ♯II° or ♭III° is a ii-V in minor key a major third above the key. e.g. Key of F, substitute for G♯° (♯II°) or Ab° (♭III°) is Bmin7♭5 E7♭9.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="a">
<li>On I°, use the rules of ♯II°/♭III° since the notes are the same.</li>
<li>On the substitute for ♯I°, the analysis will be iii minor seven flat five to VI7 (VI7 uses H – P5↓).</li>
<li>On the substitute for ♯II°/♭III° the analysis will be ♯IV minor seven flat five to VII7 locrian.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h2>II.</h2>
<h3>Voice Leading Rules</h3>

<ol class="a">
<p>PC – Primary Climax</p>
<p>SC – Secondary Climax</p>
<p>PD – Prime Dissonance</p>

<li>Analyze melody for PC and SC.</li>
<li>The melodic contour will suggest the size, shape, and amount of PD in the voices.</li>
<li>Identify all half-steps in the scale: half-steps are where the action is.</li>
<li>Set the size of important voicing/voices by placing the bottom voice first.</li>
<li>Next, choose the amount and placement of PD.</li>
<li>The lower on placement of PDs, the richer it will be.</li>
<li>Build remainder of voicing from the top down.</li>
<li>Choose notes because of their intervallic relationship with all other notes in the voicing/voices (adjacent and non-adjacent).</li>
<li>Consonance gives plainness. Dissonance gives richness.</li>
<li>Notes come from the available note-scale of the mode.</li>
<li>Don’t use “Avoid” notes, or “Should Avoid” notes.</li>
<li>Conditional “Avoid” notes are not to be used because of melodic, scale, and PD considerations.</li>
<li>No seconds, major or minor, in top two voices except clusters or percussive effects.</li>
<li>In a cluster, it’s a major seventh or less between the outside two voices.</li>
<li>No augmented fourths in the top two voices.</li>
<li>Don’t separate seconds, major or minor, from the adjacent voice above and below by more than augmented fourth EXCEPT when the seconds are separated from the bottom voice, where anything goes.</li>
<li>No more than a major sixth, and preferably a perfect fifth, between adjacent voices, EXCEPT between bottom two voices, where anything goes.</li>
<li>No ♭9 intervals between any two intervals, adjacent or not adjacent interval, EXCEPT ♭9/V ♭9/I Imaj7//maj7 ♭V/♭IV//min7♭5 except when ♭5 is in the lead.</li>
<li>No 5 or ♭5 in the same voicing EXCEPT for lydian-major.</li>
<li>The above rule also pertains to lydian flat 7.</li>
<li>No 5 or ♯5 in the same voicing, EXCEPT in tonic minor. e.g. IIImin7phrygian.</li>
<li>The above rule also pertains to dominant seven harmonic minor seven.</li>
<li>This system gives functions other than I in the bass and this is desirable. When this occurs, imagine a root directly beneath the bottom note in each voicing and apply the Lower Interval Limits (LIL).</li>
<li>Lower Interval Limits (LIL) are the lowest combination of two notes that may sound sensible for most applications. It is subjective to an extent.</li>

<img src="exampleIIa.png" alt="Lower Intervals Limits (LIL)" border=0 height=375 width=1150>

<li>♭5 on a dominant seven – when it is in the scale, may function as low as you want, given rule XXIV.</li>
<li>4 on non-tonic minor 7 and minor seven flat 5 may function as low as desired, given rule XXIV.</li>
<li>The bottom 3 or 4 voices must not outline a basic chord that is formed for the intended chord.</li>
<li>Doublings are okay, if they enhance the desired richness or plainness.</li>

</ol>

<h2>III.</h2>
<h3>Line Rules</h3>

<ol class="a">
	
<p>HP – Harmonized Point</p>

<li>Analyze the melody for PC and SC.</li>
<li>Analyze the melody for HP – INCLUDING PC and SC.</li>
<li>The melody curve will suggest the shape, amount of PD and style of voicings at the HPs (climaxes).</li>
<li>Voice the HPs using interval voicings and triad structures.</li>
<li>The conditions of voicings in line passages:
<ul>
<li>Bigger voicings are small than usual.</li>
<li>Smaller voicings are bigger than normal.</li>
<li>An overall symmetry (as symmetric as possible).</li>
<li>PD at major seven and available ♭9 when possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Voice the PC first, the SC, then remaining HP.</li>
<li>Move from HP to HP in the under parts by melodic lines (the same rhythhm as the melody).</li>
<li>The under parts tonally come from the available note-scale of the moment.</li>
<li>There are no “Avoid” notes at the line points (all notes are good) (in the LINES [These are Line Rules]).</li>
<li>Out of scale chromatics may be used (BE CAREFUL).</li>
<li>Out of scale chromatics: a note that moves up or down by a half-step in a scale note.</li>
<li>No consecutive out of scale chromatics.</li>
<li>No consecutive seconds in top two voices.</li>
<li>No b9 intervals in the LINES with the same exceptions as the voicing rules.</li>
<li>All the other interval rules from the voicing rules DO NOT APPLY (LIL, “Avoid” notes, seconds separated, etc).</li>
<li>No inner part may move more than a whole-tone more than the lead voice (conservative rules for the purpose of this course).</li>
<li>When the lead moves, under parts must move (no repeated notes).</li>
<li>Doublings at the perfect octave or unison is okay.</li>
<li>Doublings must be prepared and resolved in contrary motions.</li>
<li>Doublings may continue for as many attacks as desired finally resolving in contrary motion.</li>
<li>Under parts must be in tonal character with the lead:
<ul>
<li>Blue note</li>
<li>Various altered dominant sevens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contrary motion in at least one voice is desired.</li>
<li>Parts may and should cross.</li>
<li>Allow enough space to work the lines.</li>
<li>Line rules apply only into and out of HPs.</li>
<li>Move as smoothly as possible into the first instance  of a non-diatonic note.</li>
<li>When using an out of scale chromatic in the lead do not use a scale note in the under parts that is half a step above or below in any octave.</li>
<li>This technique is useful in going from unison to a voicing or vice versa.</li>
<li>PD at the line points (anywhere in line) must not exceed PD at the related HP (based on the HP with the lowest amount of PD).</li>
<li>The suggested order of working lines:
<ul>
<li>Lead line</li>
<li>Bottom</li>
<li>Second voice</li>
<li>Any or all others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The last melodic attack before a harmonized point often resembles an approach harmonization. When this occurs, allow it to complete itself.</li>
<li>Do not write any line you cannot sing.</li>

<img src="exampleIIIaEDIT.png" alt="Line Rules Example a" border=0 height=250 width=900>

<p>Take note of the expansion of the line going into the HP (Harmonized Point) at the point of climax. Climax is PD (Primary Dissonance).</p>

<img src="exampleIIIbEDIT.png" alt="Line Rules Example b" border=0 height=300 width=900>

<p>Multiple HPs (Harmonized Points) can be used for emphasis. Follow the shape of the melody and pinpoint the climax of a line.</p>

</ol>

<h2>IV.</h2>
<h3>Melodic Analysis - Suggestions for Notes to be Harmonized</h3>

<ol class="a">

<li>Notes of long duration:
<ul>
<li>Ballad: quarter or longer</li>
<li>Medium tempo (not ballad): 1 and ½ beats or longer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The first important note of a change in key.</li>
<li>The first important note of a change of “modality” within a key.</li>
<li>The first important note of a non-diatonic chord within a key.</li>
<li>Notes preceded and/or followed by interval of a major third or larger except minor third or larger a point of melodic turn.</li>
<li>Note followed by rests.</li>
<li>Notes in percussive phrases.</li>
<li>Notes in arpeggiated phrases.</li>
<li>Accented notes.</li>
<li>Any note that you deem important enough to harmonize.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="a">
<li>The first note of a phrase and/or a note preceded by a rest doesn’t necessarily have to be harmonized.</li>
<li>These rules are not right or wrong, but conservative suggestions.</li>
<li>“Change of modality” – that term is used loosely.</li>

</ul>

<h2>V.</h2>
<h3>Concerting of Voicings</h3>

<ol = class="a">

<li>Voice the brass first, allowing enough space between the brass notes.</li>
<li>Brass do not have to sound or satisfy the voicing rules as a section.</li>
<li>Insert the saxophones between the brass voicings.</li>
<li>Saxes do not have to sound or satisfy the voicing rule as a section.</li>
<li>ALL voices must satisfy the voicing rules.</li>
<li>No adjacent brass or adjacent reed voices except in extreme register situations. This would look like: trumpet → sax → trumpet → sax → trombone → sax → trombone → etc.</li>
<li>NO doublings at the perfect unison within a section; doublings at the octave or more are okay.</li>
<li>Do not use this technique when the lead is below treble clef in-staff A.</li>
<li>Beware of the b9 between the high reed and the low brass.</li>

<img src="exampleVaEDIT.png" alt="Voicing Example a" border=0 height=325 width=325>
<p>The tight range necessitates the adjacent brass and reed voicings.</p>
<p>It is a fine, but not an ideal concerting of voicings in a grand sense.</p>
<img src="exampleVbEDIT.png" alt="Voicing Example b" border=0 height=325 width=325>
<p>The wider range allows for minimal adjacent brass and reed voicings.</p>
<p>Each section sounds great on their own and has minimal overlap.</p>

</ol>

<h3>Concerting of Lines</h3>

<ol class="a">

<li>Use line rules on brass, then on saxes.</li>
<li>Watch out for ♭9 when doubling.</li>
<li>It is a good idea not to couple lead brass and reeds.</li>

</ol>

<h2>VI.</h2>
<h3>Practical Applications of Voicings in Linewriting</h3>

<ol class="a">

<li>Linewriting consists of lines and climax points.</li>
<li>Consider the treatment of melody with control of dissonances to contrast consonance.</li>
<li>Spread voicing has the root in the bass. It is good for non-busy parts or percussive hits and punches.</li>
<li>Spread voicing is also called open voicing.</li>
<li>Closed voicing can or can not have root in the bass - you be the judge.</li>
<li>Closed voicing is also called cluster voicing.</li>

<img src="exampleVIa.png" alt="Spread Voicing" border=0 height=200 width=450>

<p>Spread voicings generally have larger intervals such as P4, P5, m6, and M6.</p>

<img src="exampleVIb.png" alt="Closed Voicing" border=0 height=175 width=450>

<p>Closed voicings generally have smaller intervals such as m2, M2, and M3.</p>

<img src="exampleVIIa.png" alt="Closed Voicing in Linewriting" border=0 height=300 width=1000>

<p>The above closed voicings can be used consecutively for effect.</p>

<img src="exampleVIIbEDIT.png" alt="Fourths Voicing in Linewriting" border=0 height=300 width=1000>

<p>Utilizing perfect fourths can provide a unanimous balance of consonance and dissonance.</p>

<img src="exampleVIIc.png" alt="Spread Voicing in Linewriting" border=0 height=350 width=1000>

<p>Spread voicings can also be used consecutively for effect.</p>

</ol>

<h2>VII.</h2>
<h3>Sonancy</h3>

<ol class="a">
<li>Consonance is polar opposite of dissonance.</li>
<li>The action is at climax points; the rest is just lines.</li>
<li>Consonance can be highlighted using climax points and lines.</li>
<li>Dissonance can be highlighted using climax points and lines.</li>
<li>Really, just moving notes can be anything.</li>

<p>Below is the Sonancy Spectrum:</p>

<img src="exampleVIIIaEDIT.png" alt="Sonancy Spectrum" border=0 height=157 width=1644>

<p>Take note that there is no tri-tone included in the Sonancy Spectrum. Derive from that what you wish.</p>
</ol>

<h3>Sonancy in Action</h3>

<ol class="a">
<p>The four examples below show different ways of treating the same melodic line.</p>
<p>Analyze what rules are being applied and how sonancy is being used to produce the desired effect.</p>
